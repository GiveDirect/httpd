Overview: 

The new implementation does the same download on the server using wget to the anchor APIs to pull down a json file... Next 
we build a series for "sed" regular expressions dynamically with the downloads json data using python... Finally we apply 
the "sed" expressions to a template file replacing all the static tags with live data and clean up.... This job will be 
scheduled to  run at the same frequency (morning and night daily) to keep the addresses and min. deposit amounts fresh... I'll 
also, be checking the code in to the git for reference... Let me know if you have questions...   Cheers!
